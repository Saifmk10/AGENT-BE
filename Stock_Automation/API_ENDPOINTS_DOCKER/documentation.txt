HOW IS THE DOCKER WORKING ?

- the docker is accessing the data from the main.py file , main.py file acts as the wrapper where all the api functions are added and the end point is created

DOES THE API END POINT RUN ON ITS OWN?

- the api end points are stored in the wrapper and then the main.py is run with the uvicorn command by fastapi , this opens the port 1555 in the server making it accessable by curl

HOW CAN WAS THE API MADE PUBLIC? 

- the api is made public with the help of cloud flare and with the domain saifmk.wesbite where the DNS was added and then config with CF , we run the tunnel inorder to make the api public

WHAT ARE THE API ENDPOINTS??

- [SEARCH API] - https://stock-api.saifmk.website/stock
- [SEARCH API LOCAL] - curl http://localhost:1555/stock/YESBANK 

WHERE CAN I FIND THE FILES AND CONFIG , JSON OF THE CLOUD FLARED?

- in the server the folders and all the files related to the cloud flare are added in the ~/.cloudflare the yml file is the main file where all the configs are added
